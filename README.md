### Design Thinking and Learnings

Terminal:
`javac Main.java && java Main.java`

In this project, the Adapter Pattern provided a flexible solution for integrating the third-party authentication API without the need for extensive modifications to our existing application or the third-party API. This pattern allowed us to encapsulate the interface incompatibilities within the adapter, making our application more modular and easier to maintain.

Through the implementation of this pattern, we learned the importance of designing our application in a way that can accommodate future changes or integrations with minimal effort. The Adapter Pattern demonstrated its value in enabling communication between components that would otherwise be incompatible, highlighting the importance of design patterns in software development for solving common design issues.
