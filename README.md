### Design Thinking and Learnings

In this project, the Adapter Pattern provided a flexible solution for integrating the third-party authentication API without the need for extensive modifications to our existing application or the third-party API. This pattern allowed us to encapsulate the interface incompatibilities within the adapter, making our application more modular and easier to maintain.

Through the implementation of this pattern, we learned the importance of designing our application in a way that can accommodate future changes or integrations with minimal effort. The Adapter Pattern demonstrated its value in enabling communication between components that would otherwise be incompatible, highlighting the importance of design patterns in software development for solving common design issues.

This experience has reinforced the concept that software design patterns are not just theoretical concepts but practical solutions to real-world problems. It has also encouraged us to think more abstractly about problem-solving and to consider the long-term maintainability and scalability of our code. The Adapter Pattern, in particular, has shown us the power of abstraction and encapsulation in achieving flexible and maintainable software designs.
